<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's<em>lasagna</em> is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.
    There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>
<h3> Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li> 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li> 1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
    <li> 3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps</h3>
<ol> 
    <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.  </li>
    <li>The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
    <li> Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        From there, it's just an assembly job. </li>
     <li> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
            Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
</ol>
